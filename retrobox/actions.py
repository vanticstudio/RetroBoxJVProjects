"""The abstract "remote control" vocabulary.

Every input backend (a USB/IR remote seen as a keyboard, the TV's own remote
over HDMI-CEC, or the developer's keyboard over stdin) is translated into one
of these high-level :class:`Action` values. The rest of the application only
ever deals with actions, never with raw key codes, which keeps the input
handling decoupled from the application logic.
